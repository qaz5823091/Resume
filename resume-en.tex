\section*{Professional Summary}
I'm a Mobile Engineer specializing in Android and iOS app development using Flutter, with a solid foundation in native Android development. I completed an Android internship at a technology company and have experience as a high school IT course speaker, as well as a teaching assistant in college.

Beyond mobile development, I'm passionate about becoming a well-rounded Software Engineer. I'm eager to explore backend, frontend, and other areas of software engineering and also interested in how software can be applied in different professional fields. I enjoy learning new skills, sharing knowledge, and turning ideas into real, published projects.

Feel free to contact me via email if you're looking for a motivated and versatile software engineer.
